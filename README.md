## MONEY MANAGER in C++ (Console Based)

**Overview**

A money manager system in C++ is a program that helps individuals keep track of their finances. It allows users to input their income, set and track their expenses for different categories, and generate reports summarizing their financial situation. The system also includes features such as a wishlist or goals section to motivate users to save towards specific objectives.

The following are the general tasks of the project:

1. **When the user logs in, the program lets them manage expense categories, enter the amounts, and then track their expenses.**

    * The user should be able to create, edit, and delete expense categories.
    * The user should be able to enter the amount of each expense, along with the date and category.
    * The program should track the total expenses for each category and the overall expenses.

2. **Based on the user input, the program provides a financial report, generating the total expenses, remaining balance, and spending alerts.**

    * The program should generate a financial report that summarizes the user's financial situation.
    * The report should include the total income and expenses for a given period of time.
    * The report should also include the remaining balance and any spending alerts.
